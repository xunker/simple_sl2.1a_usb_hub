# "SLuper SLimple" SL2.1A USB 2.0 Hub

A 4-port USB 2.0 hub on a 1-inch (25.4mm) square board. Utilizes the
(hand-solderable) SL2.1A IC with footprint for an optional crystal oscillator.

Uses only surface-mount components and, except for the IC and (optional)
crystal, all of them can be found in your parts bin or scavenged from other
equipment.

The PCB can be hand-etched on a single-sized PCB, as long as jumper wires are
added to connect all the 5V pins for the USB connections.
